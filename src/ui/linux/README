Toggl Desktop app requires Qt 5.5 and Poco libraries version 1.6.1 to run.
These libraries *are not* packaged with the Toggl Desktop app.

To install Qt and Poco libraries, please follow these links:

http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
http://pocoproject.org/releases/poco-1.6.1/poco-1.6.1-all.tar.gz

After building and installing Qt and Poco libraries, you'll need
to add the libraries to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order for the
Toggl Desktop app to run. You can run add it each time you run the
Toggl Desktop app like this:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tanel/poco/lib/Linux/x86_64:/home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib ./TogglDesktop

(Assuming the Poco libraries are installed at /home/tanel/poco/lib/Linux/x86_64
and the Qt libraries at /home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib)

Or you can append the libraries permanently like this:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tanel/poco/lib/Linux/x86_64:/home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib

(Then just type ./TogglDesktop to run the Toggl Desktop app).

Please note that the Poco and Qt libraries may or may not be
available on your distro. Installing the libraries from source
is possible on any Linux platform.

Should you experience any problems, please contact the Toggl
Desktop app developers at:

	support@toggl.com

Or create a new Github issue directly, by visiting:

	https://github.com/toggl/toggldesktop/issues/new

If you're able to run the Toggl Desktop app, then you
can also send feedback directly from the app itself.
In that case, log files are automatically included with
the feedback to resolve the issue faster.
